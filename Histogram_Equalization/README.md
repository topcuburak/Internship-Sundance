Histogram equalization is an algorithm used to manipulate pixel densities in grayscale images to increase understandilibity of the images. 
For more detail about the algorithm, one can visit corresponding wikipedia page from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization. Also, shared pptx file is the 
presentation file presented in the HiPEAC student challenge evet. This file also describes the algorithm.

In this work, we tried to compare power consumption and performance values among CPU, GPU and FPGA. The source code of the algorithm implemented in Verilog can be found in the src file.
